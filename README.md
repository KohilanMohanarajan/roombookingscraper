# UTSC Room Booking Scraper
A script made to retrieve data about room bookings for all the bookable rooms at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus.  Room booking data is stored in `rooms.json`.  For the most up-to-date version of the script, check `room_scraper_v2.py`. 

## Acknowledgements
The purpose of this project is purely educational, and is not made with any malicious intent, or to sell/re-distribute data.  

## How it was made
The Python libraries Beautifulsoup and Selenium, along with the Selenium Chrome Web Driver, were used to make these scripts.

NOTE: Selenium was only used in Version 1, and use of it was discontinued in Version 2.

## TODO
- Scrape more days of the week/month
- Give room availabilities for a given building
- Give available rooms for a spanning period of time
- UI overhaul
- Filters for rooms, times, buildings
